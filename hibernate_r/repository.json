When there are no player in the server, the plugin can make it shutdown. And if someone want to visit the server, the plugin can make the server start again.\nIf you like this plugin, plesae give me a star!\n\nAfter version 1.1.0, you can use `!!hr sleep` and`!!hr wakeup` command to manually control the server.\n\nAfter version `1.2.0`, you can modify the `blacklist_player` field in the config to ignore the specified player(s) who is on the server and continue to hibernate. This can be used to ignore some bots(fake player) and continue hibernation (recommend for use with fakePlayerResident). Configure this as follows:\n\n`\"blacklist_player\": [\"player1\", \"player2\"]`\n\nHibernation countdown will continue even both player or any of them in server.\n\n![Sleep](https://github.com/HIM049/MCDR_HibernateR/assets/67405384/3a20a813-9bca-4e40-942c-1dbeaac225b9)\n\n## 代码参考\n\nhttps://github.com/Dark-Night-Base/Hibernate\nhttps://github.com/ZockerSK/FakeMCServer\n",
